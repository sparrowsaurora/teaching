# Now onto the 'fun' part...
# Creating a class.

# You first define a class by saying the keyword class. then we name it, and add a semicolon.
class name:

# then we can give it a function (called a method)
# But.... in the function we give the argument 'self'
def a_function(self)
    print("in the name class")

# the 'self' argument basically means 'look at your own class' to an instance.
