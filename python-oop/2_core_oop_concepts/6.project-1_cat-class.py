# Create a simple class for a cat.
    
### Goal: Practice creating a basic class with methods and attributes.
    
# Step 1 - define a class - class Cat
# Step 2 - create the __init__ method and create the instance attributes: name, age, breed 
# Step 3 - create a methods - 'meow' and 'sleep' and make them print the action the cat has done
# Step 3 - now, create a 'describe' method that show's the cat's attributes 
# Step 4 - now initialise the class and test it out!

### After you have a go yourself, we'll write one together       

# Remember: class names are written in Pascal case
