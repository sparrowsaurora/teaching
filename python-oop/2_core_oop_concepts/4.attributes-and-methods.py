# Attributes are in their simplest terms variables inside a class
# Attributes can be any datatype. including other classes.
# when in a attribute's own class. we access them by writing 'self.' and then the variable name
# attributes can also be accessed outside of their class by first writing the class name. 
# much in the same way we write self.variable_name when in a class.

# Methods are similar, in their simplest forms they are just functions.
# we call methods like we're accessing attributes. with 'self.' or the 'class_name.'
# youve already used methods before even if you didnt realise it. 
# the string method of .upper() is a common method for the string object.
# methods in a class can also be what's called a magic or dunder method.
# a magic method is a method but it can make normal function like print() and int() work on the class
# this makes these functions they are applied to polymorphic to these objects. 
# we will learn more about polymorphism later
