# Procedural Programming vs  Object-Oriented Programming

# Procedural
# Focuses on **functions** 
# Data and functions are separate 
# Example: Writing functions to manage `car_speed`
# Good for small, linear scripts
# Procedural = a recipe.

# OOP
# Focuses on **objects and classes**
# Data and methods are bundled
# Define a `Car` class with a `speed` attribute and `accelerate()` method
# Better for complex, scalable programs
# OOP = a restaurant blueprint that can make many recipes.

# a Prodecural program tends to execute all in one file. it runs without a class and often in a more simplistic way
# an Object Orriented program tends to cover multiple files and often is used for larger projects

# example of a typical Procedural program

def main( name ):
    print(f"hello {name}")

main( "john" )
