# Create a simple HelloObject class with a say_hello() method.
    
### Goal: Practice creating a basic class and method.
    
# Step 1 - define a class - class HelloObject
# Step 2 - create a method - say_hello(self)
# Step 3 - give the method the ability to print "Hello from the object!" 
# Step 4 - call the class and assign it to a variable to make an object

### After you have a go yourself, we'll write one together       































class HelloObject:
    def say_hello(self):
        print("Hello from the object!")

obj = HelloObject()
obj.say_hello()
