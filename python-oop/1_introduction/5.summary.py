# Create a simple HelloObject class with a say_hello() method.
    
### Goal: Practice creating a basic class and method.
    
# Step 1 - define a class - class HelloObject
# Step 2 - create a method - say_hello(self)
# Step 4 - call the class and assign it to a variable to make an object

        































class HelloObject:
    def say_hello(self):
        print("Hello from the object!")

obj = HelloObject()
obj.say_hello()
